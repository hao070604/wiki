**Design Concept**

The inspiration of Chaosverse came from the evolution of species in the real world, where always in the process of continuous development and upgrading. Nothing remains unchanged constantly but could evolute over time in the metaverse world, so it is the birth of Chaosverse. 

 

Chaosverse is taken by the concept of infinite evolution, and every NFT could design its own path and rule of evolutions or even multiple paths at the same time. For instance, you can imitate the real world to create seeds and water, and then you can innovate that seed and water can evolve together. You can also imitate the evolution system within the gaming world, such as dog NFT growing into wolf NFT or transfer to electronic dog NFT because of the radiation. Basically, you can do anything you want or deviate from reality to form a whole new world, like cat NFT combines with water NFT to start a house NFT in a bizarre world you create. You exist as God in Chaosverse and play by your rule. The Chaosverse could reflect your consciousness and be accepted and recognized within the creativity blockchain metaverse. 

 

There are various evolution methods in Chaosverse that could be created all by your wishes. You can imitate all real-world subjects like building houses, cars, or anything else that already existed. We welcome everyone to develop and create a Chaosverse ecosystem.
