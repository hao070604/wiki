**Interpretations**

 

**Token:** all tokens issued in the system 

 

**ERC20:** homogenized token, similar to USDT, UNI, etc., which supports partial/full pre-mining to its creators, and the rest can only be obtained after the creator creates an evolution method and set it as a product. 

 

**ERC721:** Non-homogenized Token, like CryptoKitties, CryptoPunk, etc. Each number is individual cannot be pre-minted. All must be created by its creator and set as a product before they can be obtained. 

 

**ERC1155:** is not a homogenized token, similar to 200 tokens of the same artwork, which cannot be pre-minted. All musted be created by the creator and set as a product before they can obtain it. 

 

**Evolution** **Methods:** set the evolution method, input, and result. The evolution result could be multi-branched overall probability sum is 100%, and the product can be set to empty, which means evolution fails. 

 

**Evolution** **Chain**: a collection of multiple ways of integration. 

 

**Release:** the evolution method must be released on the chain before it can be called due to the decentralized design. 

 

**Invoke:** invoke the published evolution method and input to obtain the evolution product. 

 

**Engine:** you need to click on “engine” before you can set for the evolution mode, and you need to click on “edit engine” to edit. 

 

**Evolution input:** maximum for 9 per category, which can be any token in the system. ERC20 and ERC721 materials do need to specify numbers, but quantities. ERC1155 material needs to specify numbers. It supports consumption and non-consumption types. You can always return it if you didn’t consume it. For example, you consumed this book but not a pen and created a notebook full of words. To airdrop, you need to set it as 0.01TKM but not set it as no input.

 

**Evolution product:** The evolution result could be multi-branched overall probability sum is 100%, and the product can be set to empty, which means evolution fails. 

 

**Universal chain:** go over all published evolution chains, and you can call the evolution methods in them to develop. 

 

**Trading market:** all listed tokens can be traded within this market. 

 

**Listing:** put a token on the market (it will not be used for evolution before it is delisted). ERC20 and ERC1155 can be purchased in a package at the same time. 

 

**Delisting:** delist a listed token 

 

**Purchase:** To purchase listed tokens in the market, and ERC20 and ERC1155 can be purchased in a package at the same time.
