**Disclaimer**

 Chaosverse is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol used to create ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and the evolutionary rules for building tokens. The Chaosverse contract consists of open source code displayed on the Thinkium chain. Before using it, you should read the relevant documents to understand how Chaosverse works fully. It is similar to accessing email protocols, such as SMTP, through multiple email clients. You can access Chaosverse generated protocols through dozens of web or mobile interfaces. It is your responsibility to conduct your own diligence on these interfaces and understand the cost and risk they entail. The evolution method displayed by the users is a decentralized way. You can also query the corresponding Token protocol and evolution method protocol on Thinkium Chain. 

 

You should identify all tokens and relevant evolution methods displayed on the Chaosverse on your own. No developer or entity involved in the creation of the Chaosverse Agreement take the liability of any claims or damage related to your use, inability to use, or interaction with other users of Chaosverse if your use of these result in loss of your assets, including direct or indirect incidents, special exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss in cryptocurrencies, tokens or any other relevant value assets.
